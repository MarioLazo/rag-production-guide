## 📐 Contribution Guidelines

### Adding Case Studies

Case studies are one of the most valuable contributions. When adding a case study:

#### Required Elements

```markdown
# Case Study: [Descriptive Title]

## Context
- Industry (anonymized if needed)
- Scale (documents, queries, users)
- Timeline

## The Challenge
- Business problem
- Technical constraints
- Success criteria

## What Failed
- Specific failure mode
- Root cause analysis
- Business impact

## What Worked
- Solution approach
- Key success factors
- Measurable outcomes

## Lessons Learned
| Lesson | Detail | RAG Applicability |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| ... | ... | ... |

## References
- Link to relevant academic papers
- Link to vendor documentation
- Industry benchmarks cited
```

#### Anonymization Requirements

**Must anonymize:**
- Company names → Use descriptors like "Major Regional Health System"
- Employee names → Remove entirely
- Exact financial figures → Use ranges like "$300K-500K"
- Proprietary system names → Use generic descriptions

**Can include:**
- Industry vertical
- Approximate scale (orders of magnitude)
- Cloud platform used (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Open-source tools used
- Architecture patterns

### Adding Platform Guides

Platform guides should be practical and actionable:

```markdown
# RAG on [Platform Name]

## Overview
Brief description of the platform's RAG capabilities

## Architecture
Mermaid diagram showing component relationships

## Key Services
| Service | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| ... | ... | ... |

## Implementation Example
Code snippets with comments

## Cost Considerations
Pricing model and optimization tips

## Limitations
Honest assessment of platform constraints

## Official Resources
Links to vendor documentation
```

### Adding Cheatsheets

Cheatsheets should be scannable and actionable:

- Use tables over prose
- Include decision criteria
- Provide specific numbers/thresholds
- Link to detailed docs for context

---

## ✍️ Style Guide

### Markdown Conventions

```markdown
# H1 - Document title only
## H2 - Major sections
### H3 - Subsections
#### H4 - Rarely used

**Bold** for emphasis
`code` for technical terms
> Blockquotes for important callouts

| Tables | For | Structured Data |
|--------|-----|-----------------|
```

### Writing Style

- **Be concise** — Practitioners are busy
- **Be specific** — Include numbers, thresholds, examples
- **Be honest** — Include limitations and trade-offs
- **Be practical** — Focus on "how" not just "what"

### Diagrams

Use Mermaid for diagrams (renders natively on GitHub):

```markdown
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Input] --> B[Process]
    B --> C[Output]
```
```

### Citations

When referencing external sources:

```markdown
According to [Source Name](URL), finding or statistic.
```

For academic papers:
```markdown
*Paper Title* (Conference Year) — Brief description
```
