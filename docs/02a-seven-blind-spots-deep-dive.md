<summary>🍕 <b>New here? The 1-minute version</b></summary>

<br/>

**Your RAG system doesn't crash. It doesn't throw errors. It just gives wrong answers, confidently.**

That's why these problems are "blind spots." The system keeps running, looking fine in the logs, while users get frustrated and lose trust.

**Quick mental model (pizza delivery analogy):**

| What Went Wrong | Pizza Version | RAG Version |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Insufficient or inconsistent sources** | Menu says "gluten-free available" but kitchen stopped carrying it | Data sources don't have the info or contradict each other |
| **Missed Retrieval** | Kitchen has pepperoni, can't find it, sends cheese | Doc exists, search doesn't find it |
| **Context Misalignment** | "Something spicy" → hot sauce packets | Related docs, wrong answer |
| **Stale Indexes** | Menu says $12, price is $15 | Outdated info served as truth |
| **Context utilization failure** | "No olives, extra cheese, NO OLIVES" → olives | Critical info in context is ignored |
| **Hallucination** | "Yes we have gluten-free!" (they don't) | AI makes stuff up |
| **Answer Irrelevance** | Asked for pepperoni, got pepperoni plus a history of Italian cheese-making | Response includes parts that don't address the query |
| **Answer Incompleteness** | Asked for half-pepperoni half-veggie, only got the pepperoni half | Response doesn't answer the complete question |

**This guide:** Deep analysis of each blind spot + real case studies + diagnostic checklist.

For the quick version, see the [RAG Smell Test](../cheatsheets/rag-smell-test.md) (5 minutes).

## Why "Blind Spots"?

These are blind spots because:
- ❌ They don't throw errors
- ❌ They don't show up in logs  
- ❌ They don't trigger alerts
- ✅ They just quietly deliver **wrong, incomplete, or outdated answers**

Your users notice. Your metrics (if you have them) might show a dip. But the system keeps running, confidently wrong.

# 1. Insufficient or Inconsistent Sources: The Foundation Problem

## What's Happening

The data sources themselves don't contain the information needed, or contain contradictory information. No amount of retrieval optimization can fix this, if the answer isn't in your knowledge base, or if your sources disagree, the system will fail.

```
You: "What's the coverage limit for dental implants?"
Source A: "Dental implants are covered up to $2,000 per year."
Source B: "Dental implants are not covered under the standard plan."

❌ Both documents exist, both are indexed, both are retrieved
💀 Sources contradict each other, system has no way to resolve this
```

## Why This Goes Unnoticed

- Retrieval works perfectly (documents ARE found)
- Generation looks confident (picks one source)
- No system error, the problem is in the data, not the pipeline
- Often only discovered when users cross-reference with real-world experience

## Real-World Examples

| Scenario | What Happened | Impact |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| **Insurance** | Policy docs from different years in same index | Customers given wrong coverage info |
| **Technical docs** | API v1 and v2 docs coexist, no version filtering | Developers follow wrong integration steps |
| **HR policies** | Regional variations not distinguished | Employees get policies for wrong office |
| **Product specs** | Draft and final specs both indexed | Engineering decisions based on draft numbers |

## Detection

- Compare source documents for contradictions on key topics
- Track user complaints where the system gave a "correct" answer that turned out wrong
- Audit source coverage: for a sample of common queries, verify the answer actually exists in your sources

## Fixes

### 🟢 Quick Wins
| Fix | Implementation |
|-----|----------------|
| **Source audit** | Verify key topics are actually covered in your knowledge base |
| **Contradiction detection** | Flag documents that make conflicting claims on the same topic |
| **Version control** | Ensure only current versions of documents are indexed |

### 🟡 Medium Effort
| Fix | Implementation |
|-----|----------------|
| **Source gap analysis** | Compare common queries against available documentation |
| **Metadata-based filtering** | Tag documents with version, region, effective date |
| **Authoritative source ranking** | When sources conflict, prefer the most authoritative |

# 2. Missed Retrieval: The Needle in the Haystack Problem

## What's Happening

The document you need **exists** in your knowledge base, but retrieval doesn't find it. The system returns other documents instead, and the LLM tries to answer based on incomplete information.

```
You: "What's our policy on working from another country?"
RAG: "Our remote work policy allows employees to work from home..."

📁 Meanwhile, buried in HR docs: "International Remote Work Policy v2.3"
    → Never retrieved because query said "another country" not "international"
```

## Why This Goes Unnoticed

- No error is thrown, retrieval "succeeded" (it returned *something*)
- Similarity scores look fine (0.75+ on irrelevant docs)
- The LLM generates a confident, plausible (but incomplete) answer

## Real-World Examples

| Industry | Query | What Got Retrieved | What Was Missed | Why |
|----------|-------|-------------------|-----------------|-----|
| **HR** | "maternity leave for adoptive parents" | Standard maternity leave policy | Adoption-specific leave addendum | "Adoption" ≠ "maternity" in embedding space |
| **Legal** | "force majeure in vendor contracts" | General contract templates | Pandemic-specific force majeure clause (2020) | Temporal gap in training data |
| **Engineering** | "how to handle null pointer in async code" | Sync null handling | Async-specific patterns in different doc section | Chunk split the async context |
| **Finance** | "depreciation for software assets" | Hardware depreciation rules | Intangible asset guidelines (separate doc) | "Software" closer to hardware than intangibles |
| **Support** | "refund for subscription bought with gift card" | Standard refund policy | Gift card purchase exceptions | Edge case in separate FAQ |

## The Vocabulary Mismatch Problem

This is the #1 cause of missed retrieval:

```
User vocabulary        vs.     Document vocabulary
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
"cancel"               →       "terminate"
"broken"               →       "defective" / "malfunction"  
"cost"                 →       "pricing" / "fee structure"
"fire someone"         →       "terminate employment"
"work from Bali"       →       "international remote work"
"the new iPhone"       →       "device model A2849"
```

## Detection

```python
# Context Recall: What % of relevant info was actually retrieved?
from ragas.metrics import context_recall

# Requires ground truth dataset
# Score < 0.85 = You have a missed retrieval problem

# Quick diagnostic without ground truth:
def missed_retrieval_diagnostic(query, retrieved_docs, all_docs):
    """
    Sample check: Does BM25 find docs that vector search missed?
    If yes, you have vocabulary mismatch issues.
    """
    from rank_bm25 import BM25Okapi
    
    # Tokenize all docs
    tokenized = [doc.split() for doc in all_docs]
    bm25 = BM25Okapi(tokenized)
    
    # Get BM25 top results
    bm25_scores = bm25.get_scores(query.split())
    bm25_top = set(np.argsort(bm25_scores)[-10:])
    
    # Compare with vector retrieval results
    vector_top = set(retrieved_doc_indices)
    
    # Docs BM25 found but vector missed = vocabulary mismatch candidates
    missed_by_vector = bm25_top - vector_top
    return missed_by_vector
```

## Fixes (By Effort Level)

### 🟢 Quick Wins (Hours)
| Fix | How | Impact |
|-----|-----|--------|
| **Increase top-K** | Retrieve 20 instead of 5, then rerank | Catches edge cases |
| **Hybrid search** | `0.7 * vector + 0.3 * BM25` | Vocabulary coverage |
| **Query expansion** | Add synonyms before search | Term matching |

### 🟡 Medium Effort (Days)
| Fix | How | Impact |
|-----|-----|--------|
| **Reranking layer** | Cross-encoder after initial retrieval | Precision boost |
| **Domain synonyms** | Maintain synonym dictionary for your domain | Vocabulary alignment |
| **Chunk overlap** | 20% overlap between chunks | Context preservation |

### 🔴 Deep Fixes (Weeks)
| Fix | How | Impact |
|-----|-----|--------|
| **Fine-tune embeddings** | Train on your domain data | Semantic understanding |
| **HyDE** | Generate hypothetical doc, then search | Query-doc alignment |
| **Multi-vector (ColBERT)** | Token-level matching | Fine-grained retrieval |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

```
❌ "Just increase top-K to 50" 
   → More noise, slower, doesn't fix root cause

❌ "Our embedding model is state-of-the-art"
   → SOTA on benchmarks ≠ SOTA on YOUR domain

❌ "Users should phrase queries better"
   → Your system should handle natural language

❌ "We'll add the missing doc to the prompt"
   → Doesn't scale, band-aid fix
```

# 3. Context Misalignment: Right Ballpark, Wrong Answer

## What's Happening

Retrieved documents are **topically related** but don't fully answer the specific question. High similarity scores mask the mismatch.

```
You: "What happens if I miss the deadline to enroll in benefits?"
RAG: "Benefits enrollment is open from Nov 1-15 each year..."

📁 The doc explains WHEN to enroll
❌ But you asked what happens if you MISS it
→ Grace period policy exists in a different section
```

## Why This Goes Unnoticed

- Retrieval metrics look great (high similarity!)
- The response sounds relevant (it's about benefits!)
- But the retrieved context doesn't actually address the question

## Common Causes

Context misalignment can arise from multiple sources:

| Cause | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Intent mismatch** | Topic matches but query intent differs | Troubleshooting query gets how-to docs |
| **Granularity mismatch** | Retrieved docs are too broad or too narrow | Asked about a specific feature, got the product overview |
| **Incomplete coverage** | Retrieved docs cover part of the question but not all | Multi-part question, only first part addressed |
| **Topical similarity without relevance** | High cosine similarity but not actually useful | "Send money" matches both "how to send" and "how to reverse" |

## The Intent Taxonomy

One of the most common causes is intent mismatch. Most queries have one of these intents:

| Intent Type | Example Query | What User Needs |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Factual** | "What is X?" | Definition, explanation |
| **Procedural** | "How do I X?" | Step-by-step instructions |
| **Troubleshooting** | "Why isn't X working?" | Diagnosis, fix |
| **Comparative** | "X vs Y?" | Differences, trade-offs |
| **Conditional** | "What if X?" | Edge cases, exceptions |
| **Temporal** | "When does X?" | Dates, deadlines, timing |
| **Eligibility** | "Can I X?" | Rules, requirements |

**Intent mismatch is the most frequent cause, but not the only one: always check for granularity and coverage issues too.**

## Real-World Examples

| Query | Retrieved | The Problem | User Got |
|-------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| "Can I expense meals when working from home?" | Meal expense policy for business travel | Location context mismatch | Travel meal rules (irrelevant) |
| "Why is my API returning 429?" | API rate limiting documentation | User wants FIX, got EXPLANATION | What 429 means (they know that) |
| "Python async vs threading for I/O" | Threading tutorial | Missing the COMPARISON intent | How threading works (not comparison) |
| "Cancel order placed by mistake" | Order cancellation process | Missing the URGENCY/MISTAKE context | Standard cancel (with fees) |
| "Laptop won't turn on after update" | How to install updates | TROUBLESHOOTING ≠ PROCEDURAL | Wrong direction entirely |

## Detection

```python
# Context Precision: Is retrieved context actually relevant?
from ragas.metrics import context_precision

# Cross-encoder check for semantic relevance vs just similarity
from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder
model = CrossEncoder('cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2')

def check_alignment(query, retrieved_docs):
    """
    Cross-encoder gives relevance score, not just similarity.
    High cosine similarity + low cross-encoder score = misalignment
    """
    scores = model.predict([(query, doc) for doc in retrieved_docs])
    
    alignment_issues = []
    for i, (doc, score) in enumerate(zip(retrieved_docs, scores)):
        if score < 0.5:  # Cross-encoder thinks it's not relevant
            alignment_issues.append({
                'doc_index': i,
                'relevance_score': score,
                'likely_issue': 'Topic match, intent mismatch'
            })
    return alignment_issues
```

## The Query Classification Solution

**Best ROI fix for context misalignment:**

```python
# Simple intent classifier (can be rule-based or ML)
INTENT_PATTERNS = {
    'troubleshooting': ['not working', 'error', 'failed', 'issue', 'problem', 'broken', 'won\'t', 'can\'t'],
    'procedural': ['how to', 'how do i', 'steps to', 'process for', 'way to'],
    'conditional': ['what if', 'what happens if', 'in case of', 'when', 'if i'],
    'comparative': ['vs', 'versus', 'difference between', 'compare', 'better'],
    'eligibility': ['can i', 'am i able', 'eligible', 'allowed to', 'permitted'],
}

def classify_intent(query):
    query_lower = query.lower()
    for intent, patterns in INTENT_PATTERNS.items():
        if any(p in query_lower for p in patterns):
            return intent
    return 'factual'  # default

def route_query(query, intent):
    """Route to intent-specific document collections or add filters"""
    if intent == 'troubleshooting':
        return search(query, filter={'doc_type': ['faq', 'troubleshooting', 'known_issues']})
    elif intent == 'procedural':
        return search(query, filter={'doc_type': ['how-to', 'guide', 'tutorial']})
    # ... etc
```

## Fixes

### 🟢 Quick Wins
- **Add reranking**: Cross-encoder after vector retrieval
- **Query classification**: Route by intent
- **Boost doc types**: Prefer FAQ for questions, guides for "how to"

### 🟡 Medium Effort
- **RAG Fusion**: Generate multiple query variations
- **Faceted search**: Filter by intent/category before vector search
- **Query rewriting**: LLM reformulates vague queries

### 🔴 Deep Fixes
- **Intent-aware embeddings**: Fine-tune with intent labels
- **Multi-stage retrieval**: Coarse → Fine → Rerank
- **User feedback loop**: Learn from "this didn't help" signals

# 4. Stale Indexes: The Time Traveler Problem

## What's Happening

Your knowledge base contains outdated information. The system confidently serves yesterday's (or last year's) answers to today's questions.

```
You: "What's the current price of the Pro plan?"
RAG: "The Pro plan is $29/month..."

📁 Reality: Price changed to $39/month two weeks ago
💀 But the vector index still has the old pricing page embedded
```

## Why This Goes Unnoticed

- The retrieval works perfectly (found the pricing doc!)
- The generation is faithful (accurately quoted the doc!)
- Everything looks correct... except it's **obsolete**

## The Staleness Spectrum

| Staleness Level | Example | Detection Difficulty | Risk |
|-----------------|---------|---------------------|------|
| **Minutes** | Stock prices, live scores | Easy (timestamps) | Low for most apps |
| **Hours** | News, social trends | Medium | Moderate |
| **Days** | Product inventory, schedules | Medium | High |
| **Weeks** | Pricing, policies | Hard (no visible date) | Very High |
| **Months** | Documentation, processes | Very Hard | Critical |
| **Years** | Outdated guides still indexed | Easy once noticed | Embarrassing |

## Real-World Examples

| Domain | Stale Content | User Impact | How Long Undetected |
|--------|--------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **E-commerce** | "Ships in 2-3 days" (now 5-7) | Customer complaints | 3 weeks |
| **HR** | Old PTO policy (pre-acquisition) | Employees confused | 6 months |
| **Compliance** | 2023 regulations (2024 in effect) | Audit failures | Until audit |
| **Product** | Deprecated API endpoints | Integration failures | 2 months |
| **Support** | Old troubleshooting (bug fixed) | Wasted user time | 4 months |
| **Legal** | Old contract template | Bad contracts signed | Until lawsuit |

## The Hidden Staleness Pattern

# 5. Context Utilization Failure: The Attention Blindspot

## What's Happening

Critical information is present in the context but gets ignored by the LLM. The most well-studied cause is the "lost-in-the-middle" effect, LLMs pay more attention to the beginning and end of their context window, but this can also happen due to context overload, conflicting signals in the context, or the model simply failing to synthesize across multiple passages.

```
Context: [Doc1: intro] [Doc2: setup] [Doc3: THE ANSWER] [Doc4: related] [Doc5: summary]

Position:    1          2            3                    4              5
Attention:   HIGH       Medium       LOW                  Medium         HIGH

💀 Doc3 has the answer but sits in the attention blindspot
```

## Why This Goes Unnoticed

- All relevant documents ARE retrieved ✓
- The answer IS in the context ✓  
- But the model "skims over" middle sections
- Response draws from beginning/end, missing the key info

## The Research

From "Lost in the Middle" (Liu et al., 2024):
- Performance drops 10-25% for information in middle positions
- Effect is worse with longer contexts
- Even state-of-the-art models exhibit this bias

```
Typical attention distribution across 10 documents:

Position:  1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9    10
Attention: 18%   12%   8%    5%    4%    4%    5%    8%    14%  22%
           ████  ███   ██    █     █     █     █     ██    ███  █████
           
           ^-- Beginning bias                    End bias --^
                        ^-- Middle blindspot --^
```

## Real-World Examples

| Scenario | Where Answer Was | What Model Used | Result |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|--------|
| 10 support tickets, resolution in #5 | Middle | First complaint + last status | Missed the actual fix |
| 5 policy docs, exception in #3 | Middle | General rules from #1 and #5 | Gave wrong answer |
| Code context, bug fix in middle function | Middle | Imports + exports | Missed the logic error |
| Long email thread, key decision in middle | Middle | Original email + latest reply | Wrong context |
| Multiple product specs, key diff in #4 | Middle | First and last products | Missed differentiation |

## Detection

```python
def test_position_sensitivity(rag_system, test_cases):
    """
    Test if your system has lost-in-the-middle bias
    """
    results = []
    
    for test in test_cases:
        # Test with answer in different positions
        for position in ['first', 'middle', 'last']:
            # Reorder context to put answer at position
            reordered_context = reorder_context(
                test.context, 
                test.answer_doc, 
                target_position=position
            )
            
            response = rag_system.query(test.query, reordered_context)
            correct = test.expected_answer in response
            
            results.append({
                'query': test.query,
                'answer_position': position,
                'correct': correct
            })
    
    # Analyze position bias
    by_position = group_by(results, 'answer_position')
    return {
        'first_accuracy': accuracy(by_position['first']),
        'middle_accuracy': accuracy(by_position['middle']),
        'last_accuracy': accuracy(by_position['last']),
        'position_bias': first_accuracy - middle_accuracy  # Should be ~0

# 6. Hallucination: Confident Fabrication

## What's Happening

The LLM generates information that is not in the retrieved context. It sounds authoritative, but it's made up.

```
You: "What certifications does our product have?"
Context: "Our product meets ISO 9001 standards."
RAG: "Our product is certified for ISO 9001, SOC 2, and HIPAA compliance."

❌ SOC 2 and HIPAA were never mentioned
💀 LLM filled in "reasonable" certifications from its training data
```

## Why This Goes Unnoticed

- Response is fluent and confident
- Most of the answer might be correct
- Fabricated parts blend seamlessly with real info
- Users can't distinguish grounded vs hallucinated content

## Hallucination Taxonomy

**Core hallucination types:**

| Type | Description | Example | Danger Level |
|------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| **Intrinsic** | Contradicts the context | Context: "30 days" → Response: "60 days" | 🔴 Critical |
| **Extrinsic** | Adds info not in context | Invents statistics, names, dates | 🔴 Critical |

**Semantic distortions** (common but not exhaustive examples of meaning-level errors):

| Type | Description | Example | Danger Level |
|------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| **Paraphrase drift** | Subtly changes meaning | "May cause" → "Causes" | 🟡 Medium |
| **Confidence inflation** | Hedged → Definitive | "Possibly X" → "Definitely X" | 🟡 Medium |
| **Entity confusion** | Swaps similar entities | Wrong product, wrong person | 🔴 Critical |
| **Temporal confusion** | Wrong time attribution | "In 2023" when context says 2022 | 🟡 Medium |

## Real-World Examples

| Scenario | Context Said | LLM Generated | Impact |
|----------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| **Medical** | "Consult a doctor before use" | "Safe for daily use" | Patient harm |
| **Legal** | "Contract may be terminated" | "Contract allows termination" | Legal exposure |
| **Finance** | "Past performance data" | Added future projections | Compliance violation |
| **Product** | "Feature available in Enterprise" | "Feature available in all plans" | Sales issues |
| **HR** | "Up to 15 days PTO" | "15 days PTO guaranteed" | Employee disputes |
| **Support** | Docs mention workaround | Invented a "fix" that doesn't exist | Frustrated users |

## The "Reasonable Guess" Trap

LLMs hallucinate more when:
- Context is sparse or ambiguous
- Question seems like it should have an answer
- Domain has common patterns (the LLM guesses the pattern)

```
Context: "Our SaaS product helps teams collaborate."

Q: "What integrations do you support?"
A: "We integrate with Slack, Microsoft Teams, Jira, and Asana."

❌ None of these were in the context
❌ But they're "reasonable" for a collaboration SaaS
❌ User might believe it and be disappointed
```

## Detection

```python
from deepeval.metrics import FaithfulnessMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

def hallucination_check(query, response, context):
    """
    Check if response is grounded in context
    """
    test_case = LLMTestCase(
        input=query,
        actual_output=response,
        retrieval_context=context
    )
    
    metric = FaithfulnessMetric(
        threshold=0.7,
        model="gpt-4",  # Judge model
        include_reason=True
    )
    
    metric.measure(test_case)
    
    return {
        'score': metric.score,
        'is_faithful': metric.is_successful(),
        'reason': metric.reason,
        'claims_analysis': metric.claims  # Individual claim verdicts
    }

# More granular: Claim-level verification
def verify_claims(response, context):
    """Break response into claims, verify each"""
    
    # Step 1: Extract claims from response
    claims = extract_claims(response)  # Use LLM or NLI model
    
    # Step 2: Check each claim against context
    results = []
    for claim in claims:
        verdict = check_entailment(claim, context)  # NLI model
        results.append({
            'claim': claim,
            'verdict': verdict,  # SUPPORTED, CONTRADICTED, NOT_MENTIONED
            'evidence': find_supporting_text(claim, context)
        })
    
    return results
```

## Fixes

### 🟢 Quick Wins
| Fix | Implementation |
|-----|----------------|
| **Grounding prompt** | "Only use information from the provided context. If not found, say 'I don't have that information.'" |
| **Lower temperature** | Use temp=0.1-0.3 for factual responses |
| **Citation requirement** | "Quote the relevant text that supports your answer" |
| **Confidence calibration** | "Express uncertainty when context is ambiguous" |

### Example Grounding Prompt
```
You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based ONLY on the provided context.

RULES:
1. Only state facts that are explicitly mentioned in the context
2. If the context doesn't contain the answer, say "I don't have information about that in my sources"
3. Never invent statistics, dates, names, or other specifics
4. If context is ambiguous, acknowledge the ambiguity
5. Use phrases like "According to the documentation..." to anchor your response

CONTEXT:
{context}

QUESTION: {query}
```

### 🟡 Medium Effort

|-----|----------------|
| **Claim verification layer** | Post-process, check each claim against context |
| **Self-consistency** | Generate 3 responses, flag disagreements |
| **Retrieval augmented verification** | Re-retrieve to verify generated claims |

### 🔴 Deep Fixes

|-----|----------------|
| **Fine-tune for faithfulness** | Train on grounded response examples |
| **Constrained decoding** | Only allow tokens that appear in context |
| **Multi-model consensus** | Multiple LLMs must agree |

# 7. Answer Irrelevance: Correct but Off-Topic

## What's Happening

The retrieved context is correct and sufficient, but the LLM's response includes parts that don't address the query. The answer may contain accurate information, but it's not what was asked.

```
You: "How do I reset my password?"
Context: Complete password reset instructions + account security overview
RAG: "To reset your password, go to Settings > Security > Reset Password.
      Additionally, it's important to use strong passwords with at least 12
      characters, enable 2FA, and review your login history regularly..."

❌ The reset instructions are correct
💀 But the security lecture wasn't asked for and buries the answer
```

## Why This Goes Unnoticed

- The response IS accurate (nothing wrong factually)
- Relevant information IS in there
- But signal-to-noise ratio is poor
- Users have to extract the actual answer from surrounding noise

## Detection

- Answer relevancy metrics (e.g., RAGAS answer_relevancy)
- User feedback indicating "too verbose" or "didn't answer my question"
- High faithfulness scores but low user satisfaction

## Fixes

### 🟢 Quick Wins
| Fix | Implementation |
|-----|----------------|
| **Focused prompting** | "Answer ONLY what was asked. Do not add unsolicited information." |
| **Query-type awareness** | Short factual queries get short answers |

### 🟡 Medium Effort
| Fix | Implementation |
|-----|----------------|
| **Answer relevancy evaluation** | Score responses against query scope |
| **Response filtering** | Post-process to remove sentences not addressing the query |

---

# 8. Answer Incompleteness: Partial Answers

## What's Happening

The retrieved context is correct and sufficient to answer the full question, but the response only addresses part of it. The LLM generates a partial answer, missing key aspects the user asked about.

```
You: "Compare the Standard and Premium plans, pricing, features, and support levels."
Context: Full comparison table with all three dimensions
RAG: "The Standard plan costs $29/month while Premium is $99/month.
      Premium includes advanced analytics and custom dashboards."

❌ Pricing and features covered
💀 Support levels completely omitted despite being in context and asked for
```

## Why This Goes Unnoticed

- The response IS correct for what it covers
- Partial answers still sound complete and confident
- Users may not realize they didn't get the full picture
- Standard metrics may score it highly if partial overlap counts

## Detection

- Check multi-part questions against response coverage
- Answer completeness metrics
- Track user follow-up rates (high follow-ups suggest incomplete first answers)

## Fixes

### 🟢 Quick Wins
| Fix | Implementation |
|-----|----------------|
| **Query decomposition** | Break multi-part questions into sub-questions, answer each |
| **Checklist prompting** | "Ensure your response addresses ALL parts of the question" |

### 🟡 Medium Effort
| Fix | Implementation |
|-----|----------------|
| **Completeness scoring** | Evaluate whether all query facets are addressed |
| **Structured output** | For multi-part questions, use structured format matching query parts |

# Appendix: Semantic Collapse: When Everything Looks the Same

> **Note:** Semantic collapse is a common root cause of [Missed Retrieval](#2-missed-retrieval---the-needle-in-the-haystack-problem) rather than a separate blind spot. It is documented here in depth because of its prevalence and diagnostic complexity.

## What's Happening

When documents in your index are too similar to each other (similarity > 0.65), the embedding space becomes "crowded." Retrieval can't distinguish between documents, returning near-random results from the similar cluster.

```
Your embedding space (healthy):
    
    Doc A •                    • Doc D
              • Doc B
                        • Doc C
                                    • Doc E
    
Your embedding space (collapsed):
    
                    •••••  ← All docs clustered here
                    •••••
                    
💀 Query lands in cluster, retrieval picks arbitrarily
```

## Why This Goes Unnoticed

- Retrieval returns results (not empty!)
- Similarity scores are high (looks successful!)
- But results are essentially random within the cluster
- Different runs of same query might give different docs

## Real-World Examples

| Domain | Why Collapse Happens | Symptom |
|--------|---------------------|---------|
| **FAQs** | All follow same template: "Q: ... A: ..." | Any FAQ matches any question |
| **Legal contracts** | Boilerplate language dominates | All clauses seem equally relevant |
| **API docs** | Same structure: endpoint, params, response | All endpoints match all queries |
| **Product descriptions** | Same format, similar attributes | Similar products indistinguishable |
| **Code documentation** | Repeated patterns, imports, boilerplate | Functions all cluster together |
| **Support tickets** | Templated responses | All tickets look alike |

## The Collapse Threshold

```
Mean Pairwise Similarity:
    
    0.0 - 0.3: Very diverse (possibly too sparse)
    0.3 - 0.5: Healthy diversity ✓
    0.5 - 0.65: Getting crowded ⚠️
    0.65+: Semantic collapse 💀
    
% of pairs with similarity > 0.7:
    < 5%: Healthy ✓
    5-15%: Warning ⚠️
    > 15%: Collapse likely 💀
```

# Appendix: No Evaluation: The Meta-Blind Spot

> **Note:** Lack of evaluation is a cross-cutting concern that enables all other blind spots to go undetected, rather than a blind spot in its own right. It is documented here because of its critical importance. See also [Evaluation Framework](07-evaluation-framework.md).

## What's Happening

You have no systematic way to measure whether your RAG system is working correctly. You only discover problems when users complain (or worse, silently leave).

```
Timeline of unmonitored RAG system:

Week 1: System deployed, works well
Week 4: Embedding model updated, quality drops 15%
Week 8: New docs indexed with wrong format, retrieval degrades
Week 12: Users start complaining
Week 14: Support tickets spike
Week 16: "Why is our AI so bad??"

💀 Problems invisible for 15 weeks
```

## Why This Goes Unnoticed

This is the **meta-blind spot** because it enables all other blind spots:
- Can't detect missed retrieval → No recall metric
- Can't detect misalignment → No precision metric
- Can't detect staleness → No freshness monitoring
- Can't detect hallucination → No faithfulness metric
- Can't detect degradation → No baseline comparison

## The Evaluation Maturity Model

| Level | Name | Characteristics | Detection Time |
|-------|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **0** | None | No evaluation, YOLO deployment | User complaints (weeks/months) |
| **1** | Vibes | Occasional manual spot checks | Manual discovery (days/weeks) |
| **2** | Offline | Periodic test suite runs | Batch detection (hours/days) |
| **3** | Online | Real-time metrics + dashboards | Near real-time (minutes/hours) |
| **4** | Continuous | CI/CD + automated regression | Before deployment |
| **5** | Adversarial | Red teaming + edge case testing | Proactive discovery |

**Reality:** Industry surveys suggest the **majority of production RAG systems operate at Level 0 or 1**, flying blind without systematic quality measurement.

## Real-World Impact

| Company Type | What Happened | Undetected Duration | Cost |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------|------|
| Fintech | Regulatory info outdated | 4 months | $1.2M fines |
| Healthcare | Drug interaction info wrong | 2 months | Near-miss incidents |
| E-commerce | Product recs degraded 30% | 6 weeks | $500K revenue loss |
| SaaS | Support bot accuracy dropped | 3 months | 15% increase in tickets |
| Legal | Wrong case law citations | 5 weeks | Malpractice exposure |

## The RAG Evaluation Triad

**Minimum viable evaluation** requires these three metrics:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Triad["📐 The RAG Triad"]
        F["Faithfulness<br/>Is response grounded in context?"]
        CR["Context Relevancy<br/>Is retrieved context useful?"]
        AR["Answer Relevancy<br/>Does response address the query?"]
    end
    
    Query --> CR
    CR --> F
    F --> AR
    AR --> Response
```

| Metric | Measures | Threshold | Catches |
|--------|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Faithfulness** | Response grounded in context | > 0.7 | Hallucination |
| **Context Relevancy** | Retrieved docs are relevant | > 0.7 | Misalignment, Missed retrieval |

## Case Study 1: The Invisible Update

### Scenario
**Company:** E-commerce platform  
**System:** Customer support chatbot

**The Incident:**
- Shipping policy changed from "free shipping over $50" to "free shipping over $75"
- Chatbot kept telling customers $50 threshold for 3 weeks
- Customer complaints spiked
- Support team overwhelmed with "but the bot said..." tickets

**Root Cause Analysis:**

```
                    [Blind Spot: Stale Indexes]
                              ↓
Policy updated in CMS → Webhook to indexer (FAILED SILENTLY)
                              ↓
                    Vector DB still had old policy
                              ↓
                    Customers got wrong information
                              ↓
                    [No Evaluation]
                              ↓
                    No freshness monitoring to catch this
```

**Why It Seemed "Stupid":**
- The bot gave a confident, correct-looking answer
- The answer was factually accurate... for the OLD policy
- No indication the information might be outdated

**Fix Applied:**
1. Added `last_modified` metadata to all documents
2. Responses now include "According to our policy as of [date]..."
3. Alert if any doc is >7 days old without refresh check
4. Webhook failure alerting added

## Case Study 2: The Vocabulary Gap

### Scenario
**Company:** Enterprise software  
**System:** Internal Copilot for employee questions

**The Incident:**
- Employee asked: "How do I set up SSO with Google?"
- Copilot returned: Generic SSO documentation
- Actual setup guide existed but used term "SAML authentication"
- Employee gave up, filed IT ticket

**Root Cause Analysis:**

```
                    [Blind Spot: Missed Retrieval]
                              ↓
Query: "SSO with Google" 
              ↓
Embedding model: General purpose (not trained on enterprise auth)
              ↓
"SSO" and "SAML" are distant in embedding space
              ↓
Google-specific SAML guide not retrieved
              ↓
Generic SSO overview returned instead
```

**Why It Seemed "Stupid":**
- The document EXISTED in the knowledge base
- A human searching for "SSO Google" would find it
- But embedding model didn't connect the terminology

**Fix Applied:**
1. Added hybrid search (BM25 catches "Google" keyword match)
2. Created synonym mapping: SSO → SAML, single sign-on, federated auth
3. Enhanced doc titles with multiple terminology variations

## Case Study 3: The Middle Child

### Scenario
**Company:** Legal tech  
**System:** Contract analysis RAG

**The Incident:**
- User asked about termination clause in a 50-page contract
- System retrieved 8 relevant sections
- Actual termination clause was in chunk 5 of 8
- Response summarized chunks 1, 2, 7, 8, missed the key clause

**Root Cause Analysis:**

```
                    [Blind Spot: Context Utilization Failure]
                              ↓
8 chunks retrieved, all scored 0.75-0.85 similarity
                              ↓
Context: [chunk1] [chunk2] [chunk3] [chunk4] [ANSWER] [chunk6] [chunk7] [chunk8]
                              ↓
LLM attention concentrated on beginning and end
                              ↓
Critical termination clause (chunk 5) overlooked
                              ↓
Response synthesized from surrounding context
```

**Why It Seemed "Stupid":**
- All the right information WAS retrieved
- The answer WAS in the context
- But position killed it

**Fix Applied:**
1. Sort chunks by relevance score (highest first)
2. Reduce from 8 chunks to 4 (more focused context)
3. Add explicit markers: `[MOST RELEVANT TO QUERY:]`

## Case Study 4: The Confident Fabricator

### Scenario
**Company:** Healthcare information platform  
**System:** Medical information chatbot

**The Incident:**
- User asked: "What are the side effects of Drug X with blood thinners?"
- Context mentioned Drug X side effects (general)
- Context mentioned blood thinner interactions (general)
- Bot combined them and INVENTED a specific interaction that doesn't exist

**Root Cause Analysis:**

```
                    [Blind Spot: Hallucination]
                              ↓
Context 1: "Drug X may cause dizziness, nausea..."
Context 2: "Blood thinners can interact with many medications..."
                              ↓
Neither mentions specific Drug X + blood thinner interaction
                              ↓
LLM "helpfully" synthesized a plausible-sounding interaction
                              ↓
Response: "Drug X may increase bleeding risk with blood thinners"
                              ↓
❌ THIS WAS NOT IN THE CONTEXT
```

**Why It Seemed "Stupid":**
- Response was medically plausible (many drugs DO interact this way)
- Both topics WERE in the context
- But the specific claim was fabricated

**Fix Applied:**
1. Added strict grounding prompt: "ONLY state facts explicitly in context"
2. Required inline citations for medical claims
3. Added claim verification layer (NLI model)
4. Response now includes: "I found information about [X] and [Y] separately, but I don't have specific information about their interaction together. Please consult a healthcare provider."

## Case Study 5: The Collapse Zone

### Scenario
**Company:** SaaS documentation  
**System:** Product documentation assistant

**The Incident:**
- User asked: "How do I create a new project?"
- Got instructions for "Create a new workspace" instead
- Both docs exist, both are correct, but wrong one returned
- Happened randomly, sometimes right, sometimes wrong

**Root Cause Analysis:**

```
                    [Blind Spot: Missed Retrieval / Semantic Collapse]
                              ↓
Documentation style very consistent:
  - "Creating a new project: Click Settings > Projects > New..."
  - "Creating a new workspace: Click Settings > Workspaces > New..."
  - "Creating a new team: Click Settings > Teams > New..."
                              ↓
All "Creating a new X" docs are 0.89+ similarity
                              ↓
Query "create new project" matches all nearly equally
                              ↓
Retrieval returns semi-random selection from cluster
```

**Why It Seemed "Stupid":**
- The exact document existed
- Query was perfectly clear
- But embedding space couldn't distinguish

**Fix Applied:**
1. Added unique headers: "PROJECT CREATION GUIDE" vs "WORKSPACE SETUP GUIDE"
2. Implemented MMR retrieval for diversity
3. Added metadata filtering: user could specify context area
4. Restructured docs to have more unique phrasing per feature

---

## Case Study 6: The Misdirect

### Scenario
**Company:** Fintech app  
**System:** Customer support chatbot

**The Incident:**
- User asked: "I accidentally sent money to the wrong person, can I get it back?"
- Bot returned: "How to send money to friends and family"
- User was asking for REVERSAL, got INSTRUCTIONS

**Root Cause Analysis:**

```
                    [Blind Spot: Context Misalignment]
                              ↓
Query intent: Troubleshooting / Reversal / Help
Retrieved docs intent: Instructional / How-to
                              ↓
High keyword overlap: "send money", "person"
                              ↓
Embedding saw topic match (money transfer)
Embedding missed intent mismatch (do vs undo)
                              ↓
User frustrated, escalated to human
```

**Why It Seemed "Stupid":**
- The response WAS about money transfers
- Keywords DID match
- But intent was completely wrong

**Fix Applied:**
1. Added intent classification layer:
   - "accidentally", "wrong", "mistake" → troubleshooting intent
   - "how to", "can I" → procedural intent
2. Routed troubleshooting queries to FAQ/support docs
3. Added reranker that considers query structure, not just keywords

## Blind Spot Interactions: The Cascade Effect

The blind spots don't operate in isolation. They interact and compound:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    SK1["#1 Insufficient Sources"] -->|"Nothing to retrieve"| SK2["#2 Missed Retrieval"]
    SK4["#4 Stale Indexes"] -->|"Outdated docs"| SK2
    SK2 -->|"Missing context"| SK6["#6 Hallucination"]
    SK3["#3 Context Misalignment"] -->|"Wrong context"| SK6
    SK5["#5 Context Util. Failure"] -->|"Ignored info"| SK6
    SK6 -->|"Bad output"| SK7["#7 Answer Irrelevance"]
    SK6 -->|"Bad output"| SK8["#8 Answer Incompleteness"]

    style SK1 fill:#ff6b6b
    style SK6 fill:#ffd93d
```

**Key Insight:** Blind spot #1 (Insufficient Sources) is the most fundamental, no downstream fix can compensate for missing or contradictory source data. Hallucination (#6) is the most common downstream consequence of upstream failures.

---

## Quick Reference Card

| # | Blind Spot | 1-Line Detection | 1-Line Fix |
|---|--------|------------------|------------|
| 1 | Insufficient or inconsistent sources | Answer doesn't exist in sources, or sources contradict | Source audit + contradiction detection |
| 2 | Missed Retrieval | BM25 finds docs vector misses | Add hybrid search |
| 3 | Context Misalignment | High similarity, wrong answer | Add reranking |
| 4 | Stale Indexes | Source newer than index | Event-driven updates |
| 5 | Context Utilization Failure | Position affects accuracy | Relevance ordering |
| 6 | Hallucination | Claims not in context | Grounding prompt |
| 7 | Answer Irrelevance | Correct response, doesn't address query | Focused prompting |
| 8 | Answer Incompleteness | Multi-part question, partial answer | Query decomposition |
